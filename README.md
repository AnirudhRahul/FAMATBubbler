# FAMAT Bubbler
A webpage that will let you automatically create a pdf of FAMAT answersheets, that already have their IDs bubbled in.
You can look at an example here: https://github.com/AnirudhRahul/FAMATBubbler/blob/master/example.pdf


The active link to the website is: https://anirudhrahul.github.io/FAMATBubbler/
## Purpose
This tool was designed to help schools(especially those with a lot of students) save some time when bubbling their answersheets for FAMAT competitions. It should also help reduce the likelihood of your answersheet not scanning correctly.
