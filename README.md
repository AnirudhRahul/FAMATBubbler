# FAMAT Bubbler
[FAMAT Bubbler](https://floridamao.github.io) is a webpage that will let you automatically generate FAMAT answer sheets, with their IDs already bubbled in.
You can look at an example [here](https://github.com/AnirudhRahul/FAMATBubbler/blob/master/example.pdf)
## Purpose
This tool was designed to help schools(especially those with a lot of students) save some time when bubbling their answersheets for FAMAT competitions. It should also help reduce the likelihood of answersheets not scanning correctly.
## Tutorial
You can find a video tutorial here: https://youtu.be/UNxnpLJSk4Q

Please note that this website was only thoroughly tested on **Google Chrome** for Windows 10
