# FAMAT Bubbler
A webpage that will let you automatically create a pdf of FAMAT answersheets, that already have their IDs bubbled in.
You can look at an example here: https://github.com/AnirudhRahul/FAMATBubbler/blob/master/example.pdf

## Purpose
This tool was designed to help schools(especially those with a lot of students) save some time when bubbling their answersheets for FAMAT competitions, and also to help out the scoring room by reducing the number of answersheets whose IDs don't scan correctly.
